# Bioactive_Molecules_Prediction_for_Cyclooxygenase-2_Inhibition
Biological activities of molecules for COX-2 inhibition using QSAR model (a combined use of quantum chemical descriptors and machine learning models)
In the presence of data for COX-2, this repo is contributing to the discoveries of effective drugs for COX-2 inhibition.
The application of robust QSAR model which involves combined used of quantum chemical descriptors and supervised machine learning models. 
The methodology proposed here aims at facilitating rapid evaluation of bioactivity of molecules.
The methodology projected provides excellent prediction performance statistics from the XGBClassifer ensemble model.
